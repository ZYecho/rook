The Rook Operator has been installed. Check its status by running:
  kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods -l "app=rook-cockroachdb-operator"

Visit https://rook.io/docs/rook/master for instructions on how to create and configure Rook clusters

Note: You cannot just create a CockroachdbCluster resource, you need to also create a namespace and
install suitable RBAC roles and role bindings for the cluster. The Rook Operator will not do
this for you. For now, the kubernetes default RBAC are enough for cockroachdb pods, since pods don't need talk to api-server

Important Notes:
- The links above are for the unreleased master version, if you deploy a different release you must find matching manifests.
- You must customise the 'CockroachdbCluster' resource at the bottom of the sample manifests to met your situation.
- Each CockroachdbCluster must be deployed to its own namespace, the samples use `rook-cockroachdb` for the cluster.
- The sample manifests assume you installed the rook-cockroachdb operator in the `rook-cockroachdb-system` namespace.
